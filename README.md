## Description

#### Grade Generator
 The Grade Generator is a JavaScript program that takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade based on a predefined grading scale. It provides an easy way to determine the corresponding grade for a given score.
 The predefined gradding scale is as follows; 

    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

#### Speed Detector
The Speed Detector program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

> To iterate, if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2”. and when the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.
