## Description

### Grade Generator
 The Grade Generator is a JavaScript program that takes a student's score as input and calculates their grade based on a predefined grading scale. It provides an easy way to determine the corresponding grade for a given score.
 The predefined gradding scale is as follows; 

    A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

### Speed Detector
The Speed Detector program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

> To iterate, if the speed is 80, it prints: “Points: 2”. and when the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: “License suspended”.

### Net Salary Calculator
The Net Salary Calculator is a simple command-line tool that calculates an individual's net salary after accounting for taxes and deductions. It takes basic input parameters such as gross salary, and benefits, and provides the net salary as output.

## Set Up/ Installation
